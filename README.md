************************To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps: ********************************************

git clone <repository-url>	
cd building-occupancy-dashboard
npm install
npm run serve


*********** The template includes: ***********

A room-count-box component to display the number of rooms.
A filter-and-search-bar component for filtering and searching rooms.
A pie chart component (pie_chart) to visualize the occupancy percentage.
A list of floors with buttons to select each floor.
A list of rooms on the selected floor with their occupancy status.


From loading the site to the final result, the code initializes the application, loads data from external sources, processes the data to compute occupancy percentages, and renders the UI dynamically. User interactions with the search bar and filter options further refine the displayed data, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.
